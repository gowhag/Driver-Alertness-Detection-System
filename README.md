# Driver Monitor with Eye Detection and Alarm

## Description
This project is a real-time driver drowsiness monitoring system using **Mediapipe** for eye detection and **simpleaudio** for alarm playback.  
It detects whether your eyes are open or closed, shows the status on screen, and plays an alarm (`alarm.wav`) if eyes remain closed for too long.
