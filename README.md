# Driver Monitor with Eye Detection and Alarm
# Testbench

## Description
This project is a real-time driver drowsiness monitoring system that uses Mediapipe for eye detection and simpleaudio for alarm playback.  
It detects whether the eyes are open or closed, displays the status on screen, and plays an alarm (`alarm.wav`) if eyes remain closed too long.

This repository includes a **testbench folder** with all the necessary files to set up and run the project.
